what is hmac and why required by node:crypto

what is secret, 

what is update

what is digest


from README inputs what i am getting

secretKey = abcdef;
answer = 609043;

so why 609043 is an answer 

the reason is simple 
when you combine the question and answer as a string and you see the md5 encrpted message 
it will look somewhat below mentioned

000001dbbfa3a5c83a2d506429c7b00e

Notice there is leading 5 zeroes


So I have been provided with secretkey
and i have to find the answer which will lead to 5 zeroes in front of md5 hashing

00000


what can be the name of the function

objective is to find the answer key 

i give 'secretKey' and a hash instance 

the function will be in loop until it get first 5 string as 0

when the function get 5 zeroes it return with the answerkey which lead to such situation
